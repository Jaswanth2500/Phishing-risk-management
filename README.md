Phishing Risk Management Project

Introduction:
This project simulates phishing risk management for a mid-sized business (~200 employees) that recently experienced multiple phishing attacks. The goal is to design a complete framework combining risk assessment, security policies, awareness training, incident response, and analytics.
It demonstrates both technical expertise and communication skills, making it portfolio-ready for cybersecurity and IT risk management roles.

Project Objectives:
•	Identify phishing threats, attack vectors, and business impact.
•	Create formal policies for email security and safe practices.
•	Design awareness materials to train employees against phishing.
•	Build a structured incident response playbook.
•	Setup an analytics dashboard to measure risk reduction.
