Phishing Risk Management Project
Introduction

This project simulates phishing risk management for a mid-sized business (~200 employees) that recently experienced multiple phishing attacks. The goal is to design a complete framework combining risk assessment, security policies, awareness training, incident response, and analytics.

It demonstrates both technical expertise and communication skills, making it portfolio-ready for cybersecurity and IT risk management roles.

Project Objectives

Identify phishing threats, attack vectors, and business impact.

Create formal policies for email security and safe practices.

Design awareness materials to train employees against phishing.

Build a structured incident response playbook.

(Optional) Develop an analytics dashboard to measure risk reduction.
